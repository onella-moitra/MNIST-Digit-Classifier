# MNIST Digit Classifier
This project uses the MNIST handwritten digits dataset to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately classify digits (0–9) and analyze model performance using a variety of metrics and visualizations.

##  Project Summary
- Built and trained a deep neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Worked with the MNIST dataset of 70,000 images.
- Visualized training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics and a confusion matrix.
- Demonstrated qualitative results with visual predictions vs. true labels.

## What’s Included
- Jupyter Notebook: Fully implemented and annotated.
- Neural Network model: Custom-built using Keras Sequential API.
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Accuracy & loss graphs over training epochs.
- Confusion matrix and classification report.
- Sample predictions with true vs. predicted labels.
- PDF report: Results, discussion, and reflections.
